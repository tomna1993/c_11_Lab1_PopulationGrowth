# c_11_PopulationGrowth

## DESCRIPTION

Determine how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size.

```bash
$ ./population
Start size: 100
End size: 200
Years: 9
```

Say we have a population of n llamas. Each year, `n / 3` new llamas are born, and `n / 4` llamas pass away.

For example, if we were to start with `n = 1200` llamas, then in the first year, `1200 / 3 = 400` new llamas would be born and `1200 / 4 = 300` llamas would pass away. At the end of that year, we would have `1200 + 400 - 300 = 1300` llamas.

To try another example, if we were to start with `n = 1000` llamas, at the end of the year, we would have `1000 / 3 = 333.33` new llamas. We can’t have a decimal portion of a llama, though, so we’ll truncate the decimal to get `333` new llamas born. `1000 / 4 = 250` llamas will pass away, so we’ll end up with a total of `1000 + 333 - 250 = 1083` llamas at the end of the year.

## INSTALL LIBRARIES

The source code uses the cs50 library what you can download [HERE](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

To install the cs50 library follow the steps:

1. Open git bash terminal and change the current working directory to `src`:  
   > cd ./libsc50/src

2. Compile the cs50.c source into .o with:
   > gcc -c cs50.c -o cs50.o

3. Make the library archive:  
   > ar rcs libcs50.a cs50.o

4. Copy the `libcs50.a` file into your compiler's `lib` directory

5. Copy the `cs50.h` file into your compiler's `include` directory

## COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

The code is written in C, the compiler used to generate the exe is: `gcc Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project 12.2.0`

Run the below code in terminal (git bash) to compile the source:

> gcc commandLineArgument.c -lcs50 -o ./build/commandLineArgument

To run the executable run the below code in terminal (git bash):

> ./build/commandLineArgument.exe
